# MongoBinary
Experimenting with storing and retrieving images encoded as binary data in MongoDB using Python

### What it does
Gets Facebook profile pictures of logged in user's friends using the Graph API, stores them as binary data in MongoDB, retrieves them and puts them up in a webpage using flask

#### Note:
Apparently storing images as binary is a terrible practice. Then again, this was just a simple attempt at getting to use MongoDB with puthon
